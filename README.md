## 🚀 Project Overview

Fourth project in the WinForms self-practice series.

Same four controls. Different problem.

This one takes a date and turns it into a full picture of how long you have been alive.

Three inputs: Day, Month, Year.

One button.

Results across four sections: your exact age, total time lived, day of birth, and next birthday countdown.

## 🏗️ Architecture Design

```

 └── ValidateBirthDate()
      ├── IsBirthDateEmpty()     → ShowBirthDateEmptyMessage()
      ├── IsValidDate()          → ShowDateInvalidMessage()
      ├── IsValidBirthDate()     → ShowBirthDateInvalidMessage()
      └── (valid) → CalculateAndFillResults()
                    ├── CalculateResults()

                         └── FillMoreDetailsResults()
                              └── CalculateAndFillNextBirthDay()

## ⚙️ Core Functionalities

| Section | Output |
|---|---|
| **Your Age Is** | Years · Months · Days + full summary sentence |
| **Time Lived** | Total Months · Weeks · Days · Hours · Minutes · Seconds |
| **More Details** | Day of week born · Days until next birthday |

## 🧠 Design Decisions Worth Noting

### Three-Layer Validation

The date goes through three independent checks, each with its own specific error message:

```csharp
// Layer 1 — is anything empty?
if (IsBirthDateEmpty()) → "Birth Date Should not be Empty!"

// Layer 2 — can it be parsed as a date?
if (!IsValidDate()) → "Date is Not Valid!"

// Layer 3 — is it a real birthdate?
if (!IsValidBirthDate()) → "\"Birth\" Date is Not Valid!"
```

The third check enforces that the date is in the past and no earlier than 1900.

Each error also calls `ClearBirthDateTextboxes()` and `ReturnFocusToDayTextbox()` — so the form resets to a clean state and the cursor goes right back to Day, ready for re-entry.

---

### ClearResults vs ClearAllTextboxes

Two distinct clear strategies:

```csharp
private void ClearResults()         // clears only output TextBoxes
private void ClearAllTextboxes()    // clears everything including inputs
```

`ClearResults()` is called at the START of every calculation.

This ensures leftover values from a previous result never mix with a new one — even if validation fails mid-way.

`ClearAllTextboxes()` is only used by the Clear button, which resets the entire form.

---

### Precise Total Months Calculation

Total months is not approximated from days.

It is calculated directly from the exact age:

```csharp
TotalMonths = (CalculatedAge_Years * 12) + CalculatedAge_Months;
```

The result is always accurate regardless of month length or leap years.

---

### Next Birthday Logic with Year Rollover

The next birthday is calculated with a guard for the case where the birthday has already passed this year:

```csharp
DateTime NextBirthDate = new DateTime(DateTime.Now.Year, BirthDate.Month, BirthDate.Day);

if (DateTime.Now >= NextBirthDate)
{
    NextBirthDate = NextBirthDate.AddYears(1);
}

txtNextBirthDay.Text = (NextBirthDate - DateTime.Now).Days.ToString();
```

If today is after the birthday this year, it moves to next year.

Otherwise it stays in the current year.

---

### Focus Management

Every error path ends with:

```csharp
private void ReturnFocusToDayTextbox()
{
    txtBirthDate_Day.Focus();
}
```

After any failed validation, the cursor goes straight back to Day.

No extra click needed. The user can just type the correct date immediately.
